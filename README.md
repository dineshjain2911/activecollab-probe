## Hosting

Project_name will be hosted on WordPress.com VIP Classic.

Development of the site is done by pushing to the relevant branches of this repo:

* [Staging site](http://staging_domain.com/) (`staging_domain.com`) - deployed via the `staging` branch.
* [Production site](http://production_domain.com/) (`production_domain.com`) - deployed via the `master` branch.

## Development Process

The development process follows [the standard Human Made development process](http://engineering.hmn.md/how-we-work/process/development/).

Here's a quick summary:

* Assign issues you're working on to yourself.
* Work on a branch per issue, something like `name-of-feature`. One branch per feature/bug, please.
* File a PR early so it can be used for tracking progress.
* When you're finished, mark the PR for review by labelling with "Review &amp; Merge".
* Get someone to review your code, and assign to them; if no one is around, the project lead (Lead_engineer) can review.

In addition, your code must meet [the WordPress.com VIP coding standards](https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip/best-practices/best-practices-introduction/). All code is reviewed by VIP before being pushed to production.
